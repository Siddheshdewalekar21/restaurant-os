# Mobile Responsiveness Implementation in RestaurantOS

This document outlines the mobile responsiveness features implemented in the RestaurantOS application to ensure a seamless user experience across all device sizes.

## Core Components

### 1. ResponsiveContainer

A flexible container component that adapts to different screen sizes, providing consistent padding and maximum width constraints. This component serves as the foundation for responsive layouts throughout the application.

```tsx
// Usage example
<ResponsiveContainer maxWidth="xl" padding="md">
  {children}
</ResponsiveContainer>
```

### 2. MobileNavigation

A mobile-friendly navigation component that includes:
- A hamburger menu for smaller screens
- A slide-in navigation drawer
- A bottom navigation bar for quick access to key features
- Automatic handling of active states and route changes

```tsx
// Usage example
<MobileNavigation items={navigationItems} userRole={userRole} />
```

### 3. ResponsiveTable

A smart table component that automatically transforms into a card-based layout on mobile devices, ensuring data remains accessible and readable on smaller screens.

```tsx
// Usage example
<ResponsiveTable
  data={orders}
  columns={orderColumns}
  keyField="id"
  emptyMessage="No orders found"
  onRowClick={handleOrderClick}
/>
```

### 4. ResponsiveForm

A form component designed for optimal user experience across all device sizes, with:
- Stacked layouts on mobile
- Responsive grid layouts on larger screens
- Touch-friendly input controls
- Mobile-optimized button placement

```tsx
// Usage example
<ResponsiveForm
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  title="Create Order"
  submitLabel="Save Order"
  isSubmitting={isSubmitting}
>
  <FormRow>
    <Input id="customer" label="Customer Name" required />
    <Select id="table" label="Table" options={tableOptions} />
  </FormRow>
  {/* More form fields */}
</ResponsiveForm>
```

## Utility Hooks

### useMediaQuery

A custom React hook for responsive design that detects if a media query matches the current viewport.

```tsx
// Usage example
const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 767px)');

// With predefined breakpoints
const isMobile = useMediaQuery(breakpoints.mobile);
const isTablet = useMediaQuery(breakpoints.tablet);
const isDesktop = useMediaQuery(breakpoints.desktop);
```

## Responsive Pages

The following pages have been optimized for mobile devices:

1. **Dashboard Layout**
   - Collapsible sidebar on mobile
   - Bottom navigation for key actions
   - Optimized header for small screens

2. **Dashboard Home**

   - Stacked layout on mobile
   - Touch-friendly quick action buttons

3. **Menu Management**

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Mobile-First Approach**

   - Floating action buttons for primary actions

3. **Responsive Typography**

   - Maintained accessibility across all screen sizes
   - Proper ARIA attributes for mobile navigation
   - Focus management for modal interfaces
